# Exposure-Time-Calculator

The Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) is a tool to estimate (1) the exposure time required to achieve a given polarization error or (2) the polarization error obtained from a given exposure time, where two cases are given the magnitude of the star. The ETC will work for the IAGPOL instrument installed at the Pico dos Dias Observatory (OPD) managed by the National Laboratory of Astrophysics (LNA) of the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communication (MCTIC).
